# YALPPS #

![travis build status](https://travis-ci.org/Kode-Cultur/YALPPS.svg?branch=master)

is **yet another LAN party port scanner**. The idea behind this
project is to speed up the setup phase of LAN parties by providing a
simple-to-use binary that will check whether any of the TCP or UDP
ports required by a game are blocked by firewall rules and informing the
user of the findings.

## Architecture ##

A `YALPPS` server is run from one computer, together with a list of
TCP and UDP ports that need to accessible for the games that will be
played. From each other computer in the network, a client is started.
The client connects to that server and receives instructions on when
to test whether which port is open. After that, the user is presented
with a list of ports (for both inbound and outbound connections) that
are currently blocked by firewall rules.
